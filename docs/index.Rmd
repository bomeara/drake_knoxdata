This is a presentation by [Brian O'Meara](http://brianomeara.info) for the KnoxData group on March 19, 2020, on the [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) package for making a workflow in R.

You can see code examples made for this at https://github.com/bomeara/drake_knoxdata.

This also uses

* tidyverse
* rmarkdown
* cowplot
* future

The example uses data downloaded from https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp: Flight arrivals and departures for US airports for December, 2019.

## Outline to follow along with:
